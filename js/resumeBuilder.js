During this time I learnt about the different bindings of WCF, message and transport credentials and soap and rest services. As an ORM technology we made use of the Entity Framework. To separate concerns the generated entity models were placed in a logic layer and by means of partial classes we could generate generic functions while not losing custom functions when re-generating code.Other technologies I gained experience with during the project life cycle was entity framework, MSSQL server 2012, Windows server 2012, Windows server 2012 R2, Hyper-V, IIS 8 and C#."
